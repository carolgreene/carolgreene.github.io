This has been a stressful week as the country shuts down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It's hard to stay focused with everyone working from home and one day blending into the next now that my state has issued an order to stay home.  I've continued on with online networking and sending emails to contacts, but am now getting responses that everything is on hold until we are past this emergency.

With all this in mind, I decided it would be a good time to put together a larger project. I've wanted to do a complete app with a Rails backend and JavaScript front end in order to improve my skills. The one we did in class just built off of our Rails project and mine was not fully functioning JavaScript for all classes.  I didn't feel that it was complete enough to show prospective employers since I had trouble with getting my has many through classes to work with the JavaScript.

I've been mulling over what to work on and have decided that since we're stuck in the house, it would be nice to have an app for binge-worthy TV shows. I plan on having Users be able to see a master list of Shows they can choose from. They can make a bucket list of what they want to watch in the future and Like shows once they've seen them to help other users choose.  I'm still in the early planning phase so I don't have all of the details worked out yet. I do plan to incorporate different things that I'm shaky on in my skills so that I'll gain additional practice on them. Hopefully, by the time I finish it, life will be back to normal and I'll have a brand new app to show prospective employers!
