All programming languages have reserved words that can't be used as identifyers for variables, functions, or label. I've listed the reserved words for JavaScript below along with a description of each word.



abstract........a non-access modifier which is applicable to classes and methods, but not variables

arguments....an array-like object that refers to the arguments passed to a function

await.............makes JavaScript wait until the promise returns a result

boolean.........used as a function to get the value of a variable, object, conditions, expressions, etc as true or false

break.............breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop

byte...............uses the JavaScript typeof() operator to detect what kind of type is variable x and y

case..............the switch statement evaluates an expression. The value of the expression is then compared with the values of each case in the structure

catch.............allows you to define a block of code to be executed if an error occurs in the try block

char..............a data type that is used to store a single character

class.............another way of writing constructor functions which can be used in order to create a new object using the new keyword

const............used to declare a variable as a constant in the function scope

continue.......statement that jumps over one iteration in the loop

debugger.....stops the execution of JavaScript and calls the debugging function

default.........can be within a switch statement, or with on export statement

delete..........used to delete the value of a property and the property itself

do................ do/while statement is used to run a loop at least one time

double.........JavaScript numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers

else.............part of JavaScript's Conditional Statements and used to perform different actions based on different conditions

enum..........declares an enumerated type

eval............evaluates or executes an argument

export.........used when creating JavaScript modules to export functions, objects, or primitive values from the module

extends.......used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class which is a child of another class

false............a Boolean object to represent false. JavaScript considers null as false

final.............used to state that a value, class, or method cannot be changed

finally...........lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless to the result

float.............JavaScript numbers are always stored as double precision floating-point numbers

for................statement that creates a loop that is executed as long as a condition is true

function.......procedure that performsa task or calculates a value

goto............goto is accomplished in JavaScript using the break and continue keywords

if.................use to specify a block of code to be executed if a specified condition is true

implements..used to implement an interface

import.........used to call the function to import the module dynamically

in................returns true if the specified property is in the specified object or its protype chain

instance of..operator in JavaScript that is used to check to type of an object at run time

int...............converts a primitive datatype, string, or array to its integer representation

interface.....used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract methods

let...............allows you to declare variables that are limited to a scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used

long............represents a 64 bit two's-complement integer value

native.........applied to a method to indicate that the method is implemented in native code

new............constructs and returns an object of a constructor function

null.............signafies no value or nonexistence of any value

package.....a directory with one or more modules inside of it and a package.json file which has metadata about the package

private........a function that can only be used inside of its parent function or module

protected....an access modifier used for attributes, methods, and constructors, making them accessible in the same package and subclasses

public.........can be used inside or outside of its parent function or module

return.........statements that cease execution in a function and return a value to the caller

short..........used to represent an integer value in JavaScript

static..........define a static method for the class that is called directly on the class

super..........used to access and call functions on an object's parent

switch.........evaluates an expression

synchronized..synchronous code is executed in a sequence where each statement waits for the previous statement to finish before executing

this.............keyword refers to the object it belongs to

throw..........used to raise an exception

throws........indicates what exception type may be thrown by a method

transient.....a variables modifier used in serialization

true............boolean datatype returns either of two values ie. true or false

try...............statement that allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed

typeof.........keyword that will return the type of a variable when you call it

var..............used to declare a variable

void............operator that evaluates the given expression and then returns a value of undefined

volatile.......keyword that is a qualifier that is applied to a variable when it is declared

while..........statement that creates a loop that is executed while a specific condition is true

with............extends the scope chain for a statement

yield...........keyword that returns an IteratorResult object with two properties and value
