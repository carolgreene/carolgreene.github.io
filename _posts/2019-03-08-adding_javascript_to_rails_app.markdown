Moving from Rails to Javascript was confusing for me, so when I finished the unit I took some time and watched as many of the Flatiron videos as I could. They were super helpful and made me feel a lot more confident about what I had to do for my project. I also found Brad's Study Groups & Kickoff meeting really helpful!

My Rails Project was a job search site called Top Jobs that lets companies post jobs and applicants apply to jobs.  The first thing I did was to refamiliarize myself with my app. It took me a lot longer to get through Javascript than I thought it would so I needed the refresher on the relationships in my app and just how it worked. I then went through the requirements to see where it made the most sense to add the Javascript.

I decided to start with the list of things and hijacked my all-jobs link, fetched the /jobs.json, and sent the information through the constructor(job) to create the object. I then had prototype functions to run on the object so I could format the information I wanted onto the page.

One of the biggest challenges of this project for me was that it began to take on a life of it's own. I wanted it to run smoothly for the user & ended up creating more than what was required. I have forms for signing up, signing in, posting a new job, and editing a job. I wanted to have everything use Javascript but ran into trouble doing my user object. I used roles in rails instead of having separate models for company and applicant. This complicated my relationships and although it works well for companies,  I still have more work to do to get the user/applicant working properly.

Overall, this project really helped me understand Javascript a lot better. There were so many things that we learned in the curriculum that I had trouble seeing how they all related to each other. The project really helped me get a better working knowledge and it was fun to see Javascript in action. I'm really glad to finish this project and am looking forward to the final sections of the class!
