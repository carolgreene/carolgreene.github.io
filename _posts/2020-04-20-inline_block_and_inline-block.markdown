While working on my Binge-TV app, I wanted to be able to display my data on a good looking website. When I was thinking about what I would do, I realized that my CSS skills were shakey at best. I decided to sign myself up for a short Udemy course to brush up on my skills and found it quick and really helpful. I was able to make 3 websites in no time and then did a little extra research so I could make sure I understood how the final result would change if I changed my property settings.  

One of the things I reviewed was the difference between inline, block, and inline-block for the display property.

**inline**- Displays the element inline, or on the same line. It does not begin on a new line and only takes up as much width as the content of the element.  You can not set height and width for the element, it will have no effect. Generally speaking, inline elements can only contain data and other inline elements. You can not put block level elements inside inline elements.

Here's a few of the many elements and formatting tags that default to inline:
```
<a>
<but>
<data>
<img>
<input>
<label>
<picture>
<script>
<select>
<span>
```



**block**- Displays the element on a new line and takes up the whole width of the line. You are able to set the height and width values for block elements and block elements can contain either block or inline elements inside of it.

Here's a few of the elements that default to block:
```
<div>
<form>
<header>
<h1>-<h6>
<li>
<ol>
<p>
```


**inline-block**- This will give you the best of both worlds. Inline-block does not add a line break so it displays the element next to another element, but you are able to set the height and width for the element. 

This review was really helpful to me and I'm looking forward to using these skills on my apps.
