I get asked this question all the time. The truth is, I've always liked working with computers. Several years ago I worked in banking and used to be in charge of testing for new computer systems. (Which was something we were constantly changing). My job was to try to make the new systems fail  and then dig through the output so we could figure out where it went wrong.  That way the programmers could fix the problems before they went live. I enjoyed it so much that I signed up for a couple programming classes at the local college and planned to become a Systems Analyst. 

Unfortunately, I ended up quitting my job when I had my first child and several years went by. Eventually with  3 kids, I didn't think programming was an option for me anymore.  I felt it would take too long to move into the field so when I went back to work, I just took a typical office job. 

After a few years of being generally dissatisfied with what I was doing, I started to read about coding bootcamps. The more I read about them the more they seemed like a perfect fit for me.  I really enjoy digging into the detail to find a solution and also love the creative aspect of it since there's more than one way to solve the problem!  I did a lot of research to make sure that bootcamps were really a legitimate way to move into software development, and then further research to find the best fit for me.  I first started looking into some part-time boot camps in the Chicago area because I thought I'd do best with an in-person class but  had to keep my current job.  Although it was doable, I was afraid that the class time and homework load, plus the amount of time spent commuting would completely burn me out. Especially since I still work full time.

That's when I discovered Flatiron.  The more I read, the better it sounded.  I started the Bootcamp Prep to see if I would be able to do well in an online environment.  I was stunned to see how well it worked! I love making the tests pass & think the Tech Experts are great! On top of that, the job guarantee and flexibilty made the decision easy.

I've already learned a ton and can't wait to actually move into Software Development and start a career that's perfect for me!
